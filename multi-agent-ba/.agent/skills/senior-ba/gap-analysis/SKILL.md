# Gap Analysis Skill

## Purpose
Identify the difference (gap) between the current state (As-Is) and the desired future state (To-Be) to determine what actions, processes, or technologies are needed to bridge that gap.

## When to Use
- Strategic planning
- Software migration/upgrades
- Process improvement initiatives
- Compliance audits
- Feature parity analysis (e.g., moving from Legacy to New System)

## The Gap Analysis Process

### 1. Identify Current State (As-Is)
- **What**: How things work today.
- **Sources**: Documentation, interviews, observation, system data.
- **Artifacts**: Current process maps, system architecture diagrams, SWOT strengths/weaknesses.
- **Questions**:
  - What is the current manual process?
  - What are the pain points?
  - What metrics are we hitting/missing?

### 2. Define Future State (To-Be)
- **What**: Where we want to be.
- **Sources**: Strategic goals, industry benchmarks, stakeholder vision.
- **Artifacts**: Future process maps, target architecture, KPIs.
- **Questions**:
  - What does "good" look like?
  - What are the automation targets?
  - What functionality is mandatory?

### 3. Analyze the Gap
- Compare As-Is and To-Be directly.
- Characterize the gap:
  - **Process Gap**: Missing steps, inefficient workflows.
  - **Technology Gap**: System limitations, missing features, integration needs.
  - **Skill/People Gap**: Training needs, resource shortages.
  - **Data Gap**: Missing data fields, poor data quality.

### 4. Bridge the Gap (Action Plan)
- Define solutions to close each gap.
- Prioritize solutions.
- Estimate effort and impact.

## Gap Analysis Matrix Template

| # | Category | Current State (As-Is) | Future State (To-Be) | Gap Description | Action / Solution | Priority |
|---|----------|-----------------------|----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------|
| 1 | **Process** | Orders manually entered from email to ERP. | Orders automatically synced from Web to ERP. | No integration exists. Manual entry takes 15 mins/order. | Implement ERP API integration. | High |
| 2 | **Data** | Customer phone numbers stored in free text. | Customer phone numbers validated and standardized (E.164). | Data quality issue, unable to use SMS gateway. | Data cleansing script + Validation on frontend. | Medium |
| 3 | **Feature** | No guest checkout available. | Guest checkout supported. | Missing functionality causing 20% drop-off. | Build guest checkout flow. | High |
| 4 | **Skill** | Support team knows Tier 1 issues only. | Support team handles Tier 2 issues. | Knowledge gap. | Train Lead Support agents on Tier 2 troubleshooting. | Low |

## Comparison Frameworks

### 1. SWOT Analysis (Current State Focus)
- **Strengths**: Internal positives.
- **Weaknesses**: Internal negatives (GAPS).
- **Opportunities**: External positives (Future State potential).
- **Threats**: External negatives.

### 2. McKinsey 7S Framework
Analyze gaps across:
- **Hard Elements**: Strategy, Structure, Systems.
- **Soft Elements**: Shared Values, Style, Staff, Skills.

### 3. Nadler-Tushman Congruence Model
Checks fit between Work, People, Structure, and Culture.

## Output Artifacts
- **Gap Analysis Document**: Detailed report.
- **Action Plan / Roadmap**: Timeline of projects to close gaps.
- **Business Case**: Justification for the investment.

## Tips for Success
- **Be quantified**: "Slow processing" is bad. "Processing takes 4 days vs target of 4 hours" is good.
- **Focus on root causes**: Don't just list symptoms.
- **Validate**: Confirm As-Is with users who do the work, not just managers.
