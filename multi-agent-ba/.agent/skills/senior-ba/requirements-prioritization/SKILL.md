# Requirements Prioritization Skill

## Purpose
Systematically prioritize requirements to ensure the most valuable features are delivered first, managing scope and stakeholder expectations effectively.

## When to Use
- Managing product backlog
- Planning releases or sprints
- Resolving conflicting stakeholder needs
- Allocating limited resources
- Defining MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

## Prioritization Frameworks

### 1. MoSCoW Method
Best for: Fixed deadlines, scope negotiation

- **Must Have (M)**: Critical for success. Non-negotiable. If missed, launch fails.
- **Should Have (S)**: Important but not vital. Can be worked around painfully.
- **Could Have (C)**: Desirable/Nice-to-have. Low impact if left out.
- **Won't Have (W)**: Agreed to leave out of this release (maybe later).

**Example**: E-commerce Checkout
- **Must**: Guest checkout, Credit card payment.
- **Should**: PayPal integration, Address autocomplete.
- **Could**: Gift wrapping options, Crypto payment.
- **Won't**: Voice-activated checkout (for now).

### 2. RICE Scoring
Best for: Data-driven decision making, comparing disparate features.

$$ RICE Score = \frac{Reach \times Impact \times Confidence}{Effort} $$

- **Reach**: Number of people/events per period (e.g., 1000 users/month).
- **Impact**: 
  - 3 (Massive)
  - 2 (High)
  - 1 (Medium)
  - 0.5 (Low)
  - 0.25 (Minimal)
- **Confidence**: 
  - 100% (High - have data)
  - 80% (Medium - some data/intuition)
  - 50% (Low - wild guess)
- **Effort**: Person-months (e.g., 2 months).

### 3. Kano Model
Best for: Customer satisfaction and differentiation.

- **Basic (Threshold)**: Must be present. Customer neutral if there, dissatisfied if absent. (e.g., Car brakes).
- **Performance (Linear)**: The more, the better. (e.g., Car gas mileage).
- **Excitement (Delighters)**: Surprise features. High satisfaction if present, neutral if absent. (e.g., Free sunroof).

### 4. WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)
Best for: Agile/SAFe environments, maximizing economic flow.

$$ WSJF = \frac{Cost of Delay (CoD)}{Job Size (Duration)} $$

**Cost of Delay components**:
1. User-Business Value (Value to user/business)
2. Time Criticality (Is there a deadline/decay?)
3. Risk Reduction/Opportunity Enablement (Does it reduce risk/unlock future value?)

## Facilitating Prioritization Workshops

### Preparation
1. **List Requirements**: Ensure all requirements are gathered and clear.
2. **Invite Stakeholders**: Decision makers, technical leads, business owners.
3. **Define Criteria**: Agree on the framework (e.g., "We will use MoSCoW").

### Process (e.g., Buy a Feature)
1. Give stakeholders "play money" budget (e.g., $100).
2. Assign "prices" to requirements based on effort/cost.
3. Ask stakeholders to "buy" the features they want.
4. Discuss results: What was bought? What was ignored?

### Process (e.g., $100 Test)
- Give each stakeholder 100 points.
- Ask them to distribute points across requirements based on importance.
- Sum up points to see group consensus.

## Common Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| **Everything is a "Must"** | Force ranking (1 to N). Use "Buy a Feature" with limited budget. |
| **HIPPO (Highest Paid Person's Opinion)** | Use data-driven methods (RICE). Visualize trade-offs. |
| **Conflicting priorities** | Link back to business goals/KPIs. Facilitate negotiation. |
| **Dependencies ignored** | Technical team must review to identify dependency chains (A must be done before B). |

## Business Value vs. Technical Necessity

- **Business Priority**: Value provided to the customer/business.
- **Technical Priority**: Architectural needs, dependencies, debt reduction.
- **Final Priority**: Start where Business Value is high AND Technical Risk is managed.

## Output
- **Prioritized Backlog**: Ordered list of requirements.
- **Release Map**: What goes into Release 1, 2, 3.
- **Descope List**: Explicit list of what is NOT being done.
