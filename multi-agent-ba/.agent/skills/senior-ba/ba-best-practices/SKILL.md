5. Appendices (glossary, references, diagrams)

## Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)

**Purpose**: Link requirements to business needs, design, and tests

| Req ID | Business Need | Design Element | Test Case | Status |
|--------|---------------|----------------|-----------|--------|
| FR-001 | BN-001 | DES-UI-001 | TC-001, TC-002 | Implemented |

## Communication Best Practices

### Stakeholder Communication

**Frequency**:
- Executive: Monthly status updates
- Product Owner: Weekly sync
- Development Team: Daily standup, sprint ceremonies
- End Users: Milestone demos, UAT sessions

**Communication Channels**:
- **Formal**: Email, official documents, presentations
- **Informal**: Chat (Slack, Teams), quick calls
- **Collaborative**: Workshops, working sessions
- **Broadcast**: Newsletters, town halls

### Meeting Best Practices

**Before Meeting**:
- Clear agenda sent 24 hours ahead
- Pre-read materials shared
- Objectives defined
- Right participants invited

**During Meeting**:
- Start and end on time
- Follow agenda
- Take notes and action items

**After Meeting**:
- Share notes within 24 hours
- Distribute action items with owners and due dates
- Follow up on commitments

## Collaboration Techniques

### Hybrid Team Collaboration

**Challenges**:
- Time zone differences
- Communication gaps
- Tool fragmentation
- Cultural differences

**Solutions**:
- Overlap hours for real-time collaboration
- Async communication (Lark, Notion)
- Single source of truth for documentation
- Regular video calls for relationship building
- Clear documentation of decisions

### Conflict Resolution

**When stakeholders disagree**:

1. **Understand Both Perspectives**
   - Listen actively to each side
   - Ask clarifying questions
   - Document concerns

2. **Find Common Ground**
   - Identify shared objectives
   - Focus on business value
   - Separate positions from interests

3. **Explore Options**
   - Brainstorm alternatives
   - Consider compromises
   - Evaluate trade-offs

4. **Use Data**
   - Customer feedback
   - Analytics
   - Competitive analysis
   - Cost-benefit analysis

5. **Escalate if Needed**
   - Document the conflict
   - Present options with pros/cons
   - Let decision-maker decide
   - Accept and move forward

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

### Pitfall 1: Gold Plating
**Problem**: Adding unnecessary features
**Solution**: Always tie requirements to business value, challenge "nice-to-haves"

### Pitfall 2: Scope Creep
**Problem**: Uncontrolled growth of requirements
**Solution**: Formal change management process, clear scope boundaries

### Pitfall 3: Analysis Paralysis
**Problem**: Over-analyzing, never finishing
**Solution**: Time-box analysis, "good enough" vs. perfect, iterative approach

### Pitfall 4: Assuming Understanding
**Problem**: Not validating requirements with stakeholders
**Solution**: Always confirm understanding, use prototypes, get sign-off

### Pitfall 5: Ignoring Non-Functional Requirements
**Problem**: Focus only on features, ignore performance, security
**Solution**: Explicitly elicit NFRs, include in DoD

### Pitfall 6: Poor Documentation
**Problem**: Incomplete, outdated, or unclear documentation
**Solution**: Documentation standards, version control, regular reviews

### Pitfall 7: Weak Stakeholder Engagement
**Problem**: Stakeholders not involved or committed
**Solution**: Regular communication, show value, involve in decisions
