# CDP Domain Knowledge Skill

## Purpose
Provide comprehensive CDP domain knowledge for analyzing requirements in customer data unification, segmentation, and marketing activation.

## What is a CDP?

A **Customer Data Platform (CDP)** is a packaged software that:
- Collects customer data from multiple sources
- Creates unified customer profiles (360-degree view)
- Enables segmentation and audience building
- Activates data to marketing channels

### CDP vs DMP vs CRM

| Capability | CDP | DMP | CRM |
|------------|-----|-----|-----|
| Data Type | First-party + Third-party | Third-party cookies | First-party |
| Identity | Known + Anonymous | Mostly anonymous | Known customers |
| Data Persistence | Long-term | Short-term (90 days) | Long-term |
| Primary Use | Personalization, Analytics | Advertising | Sales/Service |
| User Management | Individuals | Segments/Audiences | Accounts/Contacts |

## CDP Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Data Sources → Ingestion → Identity Resolution → Profile Unification → 
Segmentation → Audience Building → Channel Activation
```

### Core Components

**1. Data Collection**:
- Website/app events (page views, clicks, transactions)
- CRM data (contacts, accounts, opportunities)
- Transaction data (orders, returns, support tickets)
- Marketing data (email opens, campaign responses)
- Offline data (in-store purchases, call center)
- Third-party data (demographics, intent)

**2. Identity Resolution**:
- Deterministic matching (email, phone, customer ID)
- Probabilistic matching (device fingerprinting, behavior)
- Cross-device stitching
- Household linkage
- Anonymous to known conversion

**3. Profile Unification**:
- Golden record creation
- Attribute standardization
- Conflict resolution (which source wins?)
- Profile enrichment
- Historical event storage

**4. Segmentation**:
- Rule-based segments
- AI/ML-based segments
- Dynamic vs. static segments
- Lookalike audiences
- Predictive segments

**5. Activation**:
- Real-time personalization
- Email/SMS marketing
- Advertising platforms
- Customer service systems
- Analytics/BI tools

## Key CDP Concepts

### Identity Resolution

**Matching Keys**:
- Email address (primary)
- Phone number (hashed)
- Customer ID / Loyalty ID
- Device IDs (IDFA, GAID, cookie)
- Address + Name combination

**Identity Graph**:
```
            Cookie_A
               ↓
Email_1 ← Customer_123 → Device_B
               ↓
          Phone_555
```

**Confidence Levels**:
- High: Email match, customer ID
- Medium: Phone + first name
- Low: Cookie + behavior patterns

### Customer Profile

**Profile Attributes**:
```markdown
