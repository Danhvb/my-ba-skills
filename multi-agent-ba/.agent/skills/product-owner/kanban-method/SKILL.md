# Kanban Method Skill

## Purpose
Guide the Product Owner agent in managing work items using Kanban principles, focusing on the flow of value and limiting work in progress (WIP).

## Core Principles

### 1. Visualize the Workflow
- Map current steps (To Do, In Progress, Review, Done).
- Make policies explicit for each column.
- Use simple boards (Trello, Jira, physical).

### 2. Limit Work in Progress (WIP)
- **Stop Starting, Start Finishing.**
- Identify bottlenecks.
- Prevent context switching.

### 3. Manage Flow
- Measure cycle time (Start to Finish).
- Optimize for smooth delivery.
- Reduce "wait" states.

### 4. Make Process Policies Explicit
- Define "Ready for Pull."
- Define "Definition of Done" for each column.

### 5. Implement Feedback Loops
- Replenishment meetings (Weekly/On Demand).
- Service Delivery Review (Bi-weekly/Monthly).
- Daily Standup (Active walk of the board, right to left).

### 6. Improve Collaboratively (Kaizen)
- Use metrics to drive changes.
- Small, continuous experiments.

## Applying the Skill

### Interaction Guide for AI

**1. Board Setup Prompts:**
- "Design a Kanban board for a Customer Support team."
- "What columns should I add for a software dev team with heavy UAT?"
- "Define 'WIP Limits' for a team of 4 developers."

**AI Response Strategy:**
- Suggest columns based on actual workflow stages.
- Recommend WIP limits based on team size (e.g., Team Size - 1).
- Explain pull vs. push systems.

**2. Flow Management Prompts:**
- "My 'Testing' column is always full. How do I fix this bottleneck?"
- "Calculate cycle time for these completed items."
- "How do I handle expedited (emergency) items on the board?"

**AI Response Strategy:**
- Suggest swarming on bottlenecks.
- Explain "Stop the Line" mentality.
- Propose an "Expedite" swimlane (with strict WIP limit of 1).

**3. Replenishment Prompts:**
- "How often should we replenish the 'To Do' column?"
- "What criteria should we use for pulling the next item?"
- "Facilitate a replenishment meeting agenda."

**AI Response Strategy:**
- Focus on Just-In-Time (JIT) commitment.
- Using "Cost of Delay" (CoD) for prioritization.
- Commitment points vs. Delivery points.

## Metrics

- **Cycle Time:** Average time to complete an item.
- **Throughput:** Items completed per time period.
- **WIP:** Number of items currently in progress.
- **Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD):** Visualizes stability and bottlenecks.

## Common Anti-Patterns
- **Infinite WIP:** Columns with 20+ items for 2 people.
- **Hidden Work:** Tasks happening outside the board.
- **Pushing Work:** Assigning tasks to people instead of letting them pull.
- **Ignoring Policies:** Skipping "Definition of Done".
